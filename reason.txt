The expalnationto this dilemma lies in evolution.Although this is a famous paradox but we can say that we had 
proto chickens before chickens who when mated laid an egg which turned out to be genetically mutated due to some
reason and we got chicks! So on phrasing a more correct question as which came first, chicken egg or chicken,
the answer would be chicken egg.
